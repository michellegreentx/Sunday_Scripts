This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

library("dplyr")

install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")

Costa_rica <- gap.in %>%
  filter(country=="Costa Rica") %>%
  select(gdpPercap, year)
qplot(x=year, y=gdpPercap, data=Costa_rica, geom="point", 
      main="GDP by Year of Costa Rica",
       xlab="Year", ylab="GDP Per Capita")
```
#Costa Rica  
  > Between 1950 and 1975 the per capita GDP tripled.  
  > The per capita GDP dropped slightly fromm 1975 -1980, but then tripled again in the next 15 years.  

```{r}
Congo <- gap.in %>%
  filter(country=="Congo, Dem. Rep.") %>%
  select(gdpPercap, year)
qplot(x=year, y=gdpPercap, data=Congo, geom="point", 
      main="GDP by Year of Congo, Dem. Rep.",
      xlab="Year", ylab="GDP Per Capita")
```
#Congo  
  > The per capita GDP of the Congo has steadily decreased over the years.  
```{r}
Cote_dIvoire <- gap.in %>%
  filter(country=="Cote dIvoire") %>%
  select(gdpPercap, year)
qplot(x=year, y=gdpPercap, data=Cote_dIvoire, geom="point", 
      main="GDP by Year of Congo, Dem. Rep.",
       xlab="Year", ylab="GDP Per Capita")
```
#Cote d'Ivoire  
  > The per capita GDP of Cote d'Ivoire increased until 1980 and then steadily decreased since.   years.


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
